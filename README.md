Genomic Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning
Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting cancer types using genomic data and machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify genomic sequences associated with different cancer types, improving early detection and diagnosis.

Dataset
The dataset contains genomic sequences and relevant features used for classification. It is preprocessed to ensure quality and usability in machine learning models.

Approach
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and normalizing genomic data.
Feature Engineering: Selecting important genetic markers.
Model Selection: Comparing machine learning models to find the best performer.
Evaluation: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Dependencies
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization
How to Run
Install dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt (if applicable).
Open genomic-cancer-prediction-ml-95-50.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
Run all cells to train and evaluate the model.
Results
The model achieves 95% accuracy on the training dataset and 50% accuracy on test data, indicating potential overfitting that requires further tuning.

Next Steps
Improve generalization by using advanced techniques like regularization and data augmentation.
Explore deep learning models for better feature extraction.
Validate results with external genomic datasets.
